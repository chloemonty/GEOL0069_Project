# GEOL0069_Project

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Fetching Data

The goal for this project is to use artificial intelligence to train a model for sea ice roughness using RMS calculations for DEMs from drone-based photogrammetry data and HH backscatter Sentinel-1. The _project.ipynb_ notebook linked to this Github builds on the nmethods taught in the GEOL0069 Artificial Intelligence for Earth Observation module.
